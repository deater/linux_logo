4 March 2001
+ Completed the new, separate libsysinfo stuff, splitting it off
  from linux_logo
  
27 March 2001
+ Added minimal SunOS [Solaris] support.  It compiles and displays
  mostly empty strings.

3 April 2001
+ You can do a "make shared" to get a .so linux shared library.
  It works, but I am sure it's not as robust as a shared lib
  should be.

30 April 2001
+ Fix from Matt <madmatt _@_ bits.bris.ac.uk> so that linux-sparc cpuinfo
  will be compiled properly.

7 June 2001
+ Change to makefile so it doesn't depend on symlinks.  But instead
  it depends on "uname" existing.

22 October 2001
+ Fix "arch.h" so things actually work for non-ix86 architectures.
  Thanks to Ken Moffat <ken _@_ kenmoffat.uklinux.net>
+ Add support for ia64 architecture thanks to Ludo
  <lfrancois _@_ mandrakesoft.com>

28 October 2001
+ Fix Cyrix Geode bug
+ Fix obscure megahertz reporting bug

5 November 2001
+ Fix power-pc G4 printing (thanks to Nate Godin <nate _@_ WPI.EDU> )

4 February 2002
+ Fix Athlon XP to be printed properly.  Should we detect MP as well?
  Should we do something with their fake MHz values (1600+)?
+ Better Linux memory detection using /proc/iomem with the old ways
  as fallbacks.  Thanks to Sitsofe Wheeler <sits _@_ sucs.swan.ac.uk>
  for this nice patch

5 February 2002
+ Add new "Geode by NSC" cpuinfo
+ Fix support for chips with Celeron in the name
+ Added "get_arch_specifig_mem_info()" function, and
  openprom sparc mem checking mostly based on patches
  from Ben Collins <bmc _@_ visi.net>
+ Bump version number to 0.0.4 to make tracking any mem
  related problems easier.

11 February 2002
+ Ran my "test_proc compliance tests" and did some minor fixups
  in the alpha, sparc, and ix86 "via" department.
+ Added pretty printing for m68k

14 February 2002
+ Fix so RAM over 2GB doesn't go negative.
  Thanks to Andreas S. Krebs <andreas.krebs _@_ sap.com> for helping debug this.
  
10 March 2002
+ Reverted sparc PROM code because it doesn't seem to work.
+ Added support for Pentium 4 processors

13 March 2002
+ Fix Athlon XP's without a space in them

14 July 2002
+ Run through new batch of cpuinfo files, fixing anything needing fixed.
+ Added cris, s390, sh3, and vax Linux architectures

17 July 2002
+ Force SPARC to use /proc/meminfo for now, as it is less inaccurate
  than /proc/kcore.  If John will reboot my SparcStation5 I can try
  the PROM stuff again.

8 August 2002
+ Fix hppa and sh3 architectures so they compile.
+ Add yet another "sysinfo" memory detection
+ Fix up some new x86 funnies.

30 December 2002
+ A new G3 model in the ppc cpuinfo support from RJ Bergeron 
  <rj _@_ bergeron-us.net>

13 March 2004
+ Update to work with all known cpuinfos
+ Barebones support for FreeBSD

30 March 2005
+ Added loadavg/uptime info for FreeBSD based on info sent in by
  Metgod <metty _@_ hfactorx.org>.
  
14 December 2005
+ Make amd64 machines not use /proc/iomem as it seems to be 32bit only
  and not report proper ram amounts > 2GB
  (thanks to Alan Chapman <alan _@_ welsh-cob.compulink.co.uk>)

20 July 2006
+ get rid of "configure" program and try to guess the x86 architecture based
  uname -m
+ Fix m68k to try to read from /proc/cpuinfo instead of /proc/hardware
  (thanks to Christian T. Steigies <cts _at_ debian.org>) 

21 July 2006
+ Reintroduced IRIX support.

4 January 2007
+ Improve Solaris support.  Now can do CPU type and memory size.
+ Have the makefile handle ppc64 and parisc64
  (bug report forwarded by debian maintainer).
  
27 January 2007
+ Patch from  Kolbjørn Barmen" <kolbjorn.barmen _at_ uninett.no> to improve
  the Makefile for detecting ARM and x86 properly
+ Re-write the iomem memory detection.  It seems to work better on
  all machines I tested it on...

9 July 2007
+ Clean up the interface a bit.  Make sure all strings are properly
  checked for length.
+ The above should not have altered anything, but in case it did
  upped the minor versoin number by one.

30 July 2007
+ A minor change to how the error value of parse_string() is handled.
  This could cause potential segfaults with invalid /proc/cpuinfo
  input files.  Found with the zzuf fuzz tool.

3 January 2007
+ Minor change so AMD Phenom prints properly.

5 June 2009
+ Add frv, microblaze and m32r support.
+ Fix some old Cyrix chips.
+ Fix Sheeva Plug/ARM.
  
5 January 2010
+ Add Phenom II support, thanks to
  Mark Rosenstand <rosenstand _at_ gmail.com>
+ Add support for Qemu HVM cases, thanks to Matthias Saou
