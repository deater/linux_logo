  (so a cat of the header file shows the picture)
+ Released version 1.0 at sunsite and my site (no there is no 0.7-0.9
  ... the improvements were so drastic I thought it deserved a full
  version number).

RELEASE 1.0

25 JULY 1997
+ Fixed some typos in the README (thanks to Esperandi)

RELEASE 1.05

12 FEBRUARY 1998
+ Found bug in 1.05 [% signs not work well in /etc/issue.net  ... they are
  escaped... ugh] so released 1.06
+ UGH! Uploaded 1.06 as ASCII instead of BIN at sunsite by mistake.  Changed
  version of package to 1.07 but leave everything as 1.06 ;)  yes I'm lazy
  
19 FEBRUARY 1998
+ Added Cyrix 6x86 support [thanks to <adam _at_ princeton.edu>]
+ Changed to read the vendor_id to report vendor.  Idea also thanks to 
  <adam _at_ princeton.edu>
  
13 MARCH 1998
+ Added minimal AIX port [thanks to Thomas Grewe]
+ Added incredible Banner support!  "linux_logo -banner"
  Much thanks to Albert Lai <aylai _at_ unixg.ubc.ca>
+ Also added "-rX" option to change the character in banner, and 
  "-w Num" which changes width [all under banner]  
+ Made old linux_logo look "linux_logo -classic"
+ Modularized the getsysinfo.c files.  Trying to follow all the #ifdef
  statements was getting confusing.
+ Included a nice "further info" file from Tony Nugent <T.Nugent _at_ sct.gu.edu.au>
+ Bunch of other stuff to get ready for release
+ Released version 2.00

RELEASE 2.0

16 APRIL 1998
+ Finally had time to work on things again.
+ Thanks to Joerg Berg <joerg _at_ joberg.snafu.de> linux-alpha support should
  work.
+ I also rearranged the "sysinfo.c" file.  It now relies on pre-processor
  magic, but simplified the Makefile a lot.
+ Zipped up version 2.0.1

RELEASE 2.01

13 May 1998
+ Fixed it so that command line parameters were passed to the relevant
  modules.  This had been broken for some time; thanks to
  <mengmeng _at_ earthling.net> for pointing this out.
+ The boot-logo flamewar has resumed on linux-kernel, so I think I will
  zip up and get 2.0.2 ready to announce....
  
27 May 1998
+ Finally released 2.0.2.  Posted announcements to freshmeat.net and c.o.l.a.

RELEASE 2.02

28 May 1998
+ Got a lot of feedback due to the announcement on freshmeat.net.
+ Added -f option to clear screen.. thanks to Sean Kelly <smkelly _at_ zombie.org>
  for the suggestion.
+ Fixed a typo in sysinfo_{default,aix}.c thanks to zap <zap _at_ arosnet.se>
+ Added a section to the README about having fun with the -R option
+ Increased the size of some buffers so that long cpu names [especially
  Pentium II ones] don't overflow.  [Thanks to Caleb Epstein
  <epstein_caleb_unix _at_ jpmorgan.com> and Steve <steve _at_ steve.paradise.net.nz> 
  for reporting this problem].
+ Changed the 'penguin_port' in the README to 54321.  Thanks to 
  David Nedrow <dnedrow _at_ usa.net> for letting me know that port 1234
  has a reserved meaning and that a higher numbered port would be better.
+ Added Linux-Sparc support with the help of Raymond Wu <rwu _at_ ml.com>

1 June 1998
+ Added better BogoMips reporting for Sparc64 [thanks to "Eddie C. Dost"
  <ecd _at_ skynet.be>]

3 June 1998
+ Fixed typo in sysinfo.c thanks to Rod Begbie <rod _at_ begbie.com>

4 June 1998
+ Fixed problem where if there was no vendor it would include extraneous
  space in the sysinfo ouput.  Thanks to report from Mark Lundeberg
  <aa026 _at_ pgfn.bc.ca>
+ added contrib directory for possible future logos
+ improved AIX support thanks to Jochen Stein <jst _at_ writeme.com>

18 June 1998
+ Added -k switch to enable changing of background shape independently of
  foreground.  Thanks to Alexandre Aufrere <alexandre.aufrere _at_ bigfoot.com>
+ Fixed a bug on showing MMX pentiums with 2.0.34?

9 July 1998
+ Someone reported 2.03 to freshmeat although it wasn't quite an official
  "Announce to the world" release.  So I got to working on this a bit.
+ Made a patch to allow adding the linux_logo [in color] to the linux kernel.
  I think the logo should remain user_space, but people kept whining how ugly
  the text logos were with fbcon.  Oddly, I got no response for my patch.
  None at all.  It can be obtained at 
  http://www.ee.umd.edu/~weave/color-vga-linux-logo.patch
  And is against 2.1.108 with some of Geert's fbcon fixes.
+ Messed with the directory structure some more, moving the "Samples" to the
  ./samples directory.
+ Restructured source to use global variables instead of parameter passing.
  Made code much easier to follow and smaller.
+ Now default behavior is customizable by editing the "defaults.h" file.
+ Added the -l and -g switches to disable sysinfo and logo respectively.
+ Fixed up the README file a lot.
+ Packed up 2.05 and released it.

RELEASE 2.05

10 July 1998
+ Improved support for K6 on 2.0.34 so it actually works now.
+ Added support for Centaur and "Transmeta" ;) Chips.
  Note... The transmeta thing is a joke.  I have no clue if they are
  making Intel-type chips.
+ Packaged up a "2.05a" version.

13 July 1998
+ Fixed a bug where the -k and -x options didn't work.  UGH.  Thanks to my
  friend John, at whose house I figured out the problem.
+ Fixed it so it displays non-cpuid [ <486] chips sort of right under
  2.1.x series kernels.  Need to test this on 2.0.x series kernels to see
  if I broke anything....
+ Packed up and released as "2.05b"
+ Added -u uptime option.  Suggested by many people, including 
  David Christensson <david.christensson _at_ swipnet.se>,
  Allan Joergensen <dw _at_ null.dk>, and my friend John C. <clemej _at_ rpi.edu>
  ** NOTE ** involved changes to many of the architecture specific files.
  PLEASE TEST AND REPORT ANY BUGS.
+ Made it so the -ascii switch really doesn't display any ESC characters.
+ Removed a lot of redundant code.
+ Updated CHANGES and TODO and BUGS files.
+ Will release "2.06" on my web-site temporarily.

RELEASE 2.06

14 July 1998
+ Got everything ready for the 2.07 release.  Trying not to forget anything
  [I always do anyway].

RELEASE 2.07

29 July 1998
+ Finally got around to uploading the newest version to sunsite and reporting
  it at freshmeat. 
+ Had forgotten to take the "cpuinfo" test file out.  UGH.
+ Added a fix for PentiumII's on linux 2.0.x [with cpuinfo sent by
  <xanni _at_ xanadu.net>.  I wish I had access to more machines to test this on;
  fixing one always risks breaking another.  If only I kept all those
  /proc/cpuinfo's people sent me and had an automated parser... much more
  trouble than it'd be worth.  Oh well.
  
31 July 1998
+ Added preliminary PowerPC support thanks to a /proc/cpuinfo sent in by
  Beecher Greenman <rbg6038 _at_ ritvax.isc.rit.edu>
+ Fixed a centering bug in banner mode that had been bothering me for a while.
  A "+4" should have been a "+2"
+ Re-changed that to "+3", after much trial and error, deciding it was the 
  value that made odd-sized strings come out the best in banner mode.
+ Went through sysinfo_*.c, updating the files, making sure they used BUFSIZ
  and making sure uninitialized strings won't give garbage on the wrong
  architecture.

13 August 1998
+ Don't really have time to work on linux_logo, but since everyone keeps
  sending me e-mail about it, why not ;)
+ Fixed K6 printing on 2.0.36p5 [Ugh, why are they always changing this].
  Actually it was reported this kernel causes 'linux_logo -a' to print blank
  spaces for ever.  This is because one of the sysinfo lines was >80, so the
  centering code ended up doing a loop to a negative number [that wrapped to
  2^31], causing lots of bad effects.  Thanks to Nate Godin <nate _at_ WPI.EDU> 
  for the report.
+ Added information to the README for adding linux_logo to SUSE linux systems.
  Thanks to Rodolfo Pilas <rodolfo _at_ linux.org.uy>.
  
1 September 1998
+ Back at school.  Trying to merge stuff up the best I can.
+ Integrated [with some changes] a patch sent by Aleksey Makarov
  <makarov _at_ iitam.omsk.net.ru>.  This changed the command-line parsing
  to the get_opt() command, plus added the -t command line option
  to print arbitrary text.
+ Shortened the -ascii -banner and -classic commands to -a,-b, and -c.
  The old ones still work, but this is more "correct".  I will probably
  add --ascii --banner and --classic at some point.
+ Updates the -t option to work with classic mode, substantially
  re-structuring the classic mode code.  
+ Alexander Klink <ak _at_ wireworm.com> sent me a cool picture of linux_logo
  on a vt102.  See the linux_logo page [www.ee.umd.edu/~weave/vmwprod]
  for a copy of the picture.
+ Found out that there is a debian package of linux_logo, and it even
  has its own maintainer, Steve Kostecke <steve _at_ kostecke.net>.
  Anyway he sent in some patches, including a man page and some ppc
  fixes, so I merged them in as well.
  
5 September 1998
+ Fixed it so the -f and -g options work together [thanks to Gabriel Grundin 
  <gabbe _at_ linux.nu> for this one.
+ Kernel 2.1.120 messed up /proc/cpuinfo once again.  Work-around added.
  Thanks to adam _at_ cc934578-a.ewndsr1.nj.home.com for the help.
  
11 September 1998
+ After numerous reports of linux_logo being broken for > 2.1.120 I 
  released 2.10

RELEASE 2.10

13 September 1998
+ Fixed it so K6-2 machines look ok [at least on 2.0.35].

25 September 1998
+ Started integrating some info that Alex Buell
  <alex.buell _at_ tahallah.demon.co.uk> kindly provided into the /proc/cpuinfo
  parsing code.

2 October 1998
+ After awful week of exams, decided to work on linux_logo a bit ;)
+ Added a new "-x" option that uses a new character '@' in the
  banner.h file to indicate characters that can be dropped in order
  to get a "narrower" logo.  This was a problem with some people where
  the issue.net file being 80chars caused problems.. hopefully this fixes
  that.
+ Added "-y" loadaverage support.  Also re-modularized the banner output
  code.  Thanks to Anders Rundegren <anders _at_ rundegren.com> for sending the
  patch my way.
+ Packed up 2.11.  Won't announce to the world until I do a few beta-tests
  first.
+ Realized using '@' as the character above screwed up the ascii output.
  Changed it to `
+ Found another mistake where I forgot to add ` s to ascii_banner.h

30 October 1998
+ Have been busy busy busy busy doing other stuff.  Finally had time to
  work on linux_logo and try to get back to the people who had sent me
  stuff the last month.
+ Added an "-e" option.  This makes it easier for me to check problems
  with other people's /proc/cpuinfo files that they send me.  It can also
  be used, I suppose, to trick linux_logo into thinking you have a better
  computer ;)
+ Tested the new version with some of the assorted cpuinfo files 
  Alex Buell sent me.
+ Michael Somos <somos _at_ grail.cba.csuohio.edu> was suggesting I remove the
  Escape character from my C code.  I disagreed...
+ Someone announced linux_logo-2.11 long before I thought it was ready
  to announce.  Please people, let me do the announcing....
+ Peter Magnusson <iocc _at_ home.se> let me know that using "`" for a special
  character messes up the '-c' output.  Changed it to be "%".  Hopefully
  this will keep other problems from happening.
+ Audited all of the non-intel architectures.  Cleaned up and fixed a lot.
  Please let me know if anything else needs fixed.
+ Bundled up 2.12 for release.  Hope I don't make any mistakes...

8 November 1998
+ Added support for older 1.2.x kernels, thanks to Rusty Haddock 
  <rusty _at_ fe2o3.lonestar.org>
+ Added code to print the MHz if given by the new tsc code in kernels
  >2.1.127
+ Actually finally release 2.12

RELEASE 2.12

5 December 1998
+ Idea from Juhapekka Tolvanen <juhtolv _at_ silmu.st.jyu.fi> to totally
  re-write sysinfo stuff.  Will work on over break.
+ Also added sample scripts from him to contrib directory.
+ Pending re-write of entire sub-system, to break compatibility?
  Linux_logo 3.0?
  
9 January 1999
+ Ugly snowy and icy weather has trapped me at home, giving me time for the
  re-write.
+ Rewrote much of linux_logo to use a new "Format" engine.  The old behavior
  is now a compatibility layer over the new code.
+ See the README on how to use the new -F option.
+ It's a big enough change to move the major number to 3.0.
+ Tested all the intel cpuinfo's I have.  Now to see what I can do about
  the other architectures.
+ Overhauled the documentation.
+ To paraphrase Alan Cox and TMBG:
  o/~ metalab.unc.edu was sunsite.unc.edu, 
      now it's metalab.unc.edu not sunsite.unc.edu
      So if you had a file at sunsite.unc.edu
      It'll be waiting at metalab o/~
+ Pressing Projects: add gnu-configure scripts and update the man page.
  Unfortunately I am unsure how to go about either of those.
+ Added a PowerPC SMP patch from Ryan Nielsen <ran _at_ krazynet.com>

10 January 1999
+ Tried to fix things up for a beta release to freshmeat tomorrow
+ Went through bringing up all non-intel targets to code.
+ Added Megahertz printing for Alpha chips

25 March 1999
+ Finally had time to work on linux_logo again.  School has just been tough.
  This is my spring break so I grabbed some time to try to get beta2 and 
  eventually 3.00 stable out the door.
+ Thanks to Christian T. Steigies <cts _at_ ap031.experimentalphysik.uni-kiel.de>
  for sending in a patch fixing m68k and making sure it works on Amiga.

26 March 1999
+ Implemented MIPS [decstation and SGI indy]
+ Got intel up to par.  Modularized it a bit.  Sorta detects K6-3's and
  all the various pentium versions right as far as I can tell.
+ Thanks to Greg Smith <mke2fs _at_ adirondack-park.net> for sending a patch
  to fix pentium2 detection under 2.0.x.
+ Thanks to "Evert Meulie esq." <evert _at_ royal.net> for Dutch number support.
+ tim <theaney _at_ toadmail.toad.net> sent in some fixes for the README
+ Fixed the MHz to fudge a bit so 400Mhz chips are reported as that and
  not as 399Mhz or 401Mhz as /proc/cpuinfo might think they are.
+ Added the gpl COPYING file, since I've always said this was gpl'd but never
  included the license with it.
+ Tweaked SPARC and ALPHA a bit.. this version passes all of my sample proc
  files.. hopefully it will work just fine...
+ Pack it up and release to freshmeat.... here comes 3.0b2

RELEASE 3.0b2

2 April 1999
+ Not many bug reports at all.. gearing up for a 3.0 release later today.
+ Tried in the past week to get a GNU autoconf configure script working...
  I did.. but the extra overhead [doubling the size of the archive] to just
  check for gcc/cc or architecture isn't worth it.  The architecture 
  detection code would have been just as much of a kludge as the current
  sysinfo.c, and I don't have all the machines to test it on.  So for now
  at least I will stick with old-fashioned makefiles.
+ Released 3.0 to freshmeat and metalab.

RELEASE 3.0

6 April 1999
+ This release has gone a lot smoother than previous releases.  Very few
  actual bugs noted this time.
+ Thanks to Nate Godin <nate _at_ graymalkin.res.wpi.net> for a K6-2 fix.
+ Fixed some problems in the README.  Thanks to Brandon Griffith
  <project7 _at_ qx.net> for a RedHat instructions fix.
+ Ran a "tr -d '\r'" on the README to remove extraneous ^M characters.
  These shouldn't be needed [why were they even there at all?  I don't
  think I ever edited linux_logo under DOS] and were 
  causing <iain _at_ monitormedia.co.uk> some problems when viewing the logs
  using less.
  
22 June 1999
+ Got a K6-2 350 the other day, so I guess I should finally publish a 3.01
  that fixes the K6-2 Problem.  The K6-2 is nice, even though my motherboard
  [A wonderful PA-2007] can only drive it at 337.5Mhz [75x4.5].  Had to solder
  a resistor to a jumper to get the right voltage, but it works like a charm.
+ Revise the README somewhat.  I have a Redhat6.0 box at work so I can test
  out that myself now.
+ Add support for Pentium III for older kernels that don't realize it is
  a pentium III.
+ Added French support (Alexandre Blanchette <blanalex _at_ netscape.net>)
+ Added Italian support (Davide Melan <davidemelan _at_ tin.it>)  See his page
  http://davidemelan.freeweb.org for an ENTIRELY Italian linux_logo.  Pretty
  neat.
+ Changed the giant mass of global variables to a structure whose pointer
  is passed around.  Hoped this would make the code more modular, but I 
  fear it makes it just 1k bigger and more complicated.
+ Added -d option in case you want to disable linux_logo from "fixing up"
  the output.  IE, you really want it to say AMD K6(tm) w Multimedia Extensions
  or whatever your /proc/cpuinfo really says.  It also skips the Megahertz
  fudging.  (Original idea from an e-mail exchange with Mengmeng Zhang
  <mengmeng _at_ cs.utexas.edu>)
+ Ahhhhh it's late.  I have tested as much as I can, and think I have 3.01
  ready to go out the door.  Hopefully I don't have a common error, as 
  usually happens.  Off to announce at freshmeat tomorrow.

23 June 1999
+ Made some minor touch-ups, and released version 3.01

RELEASE 3.01

8 July 1999
+ Oops.  Left out which file to fix to get Redhat printing stuff.  It is
  /etc/rc.d/rc.local.  Thanks to James Punteney <jamesp _at_ mmgco.com>
  for finding this.

31 August 1999
+ The 3.x series has been a nice one, with few problems.  Recently a few
  problems have cropped up, and since this is the last day before
  classes begin, I figured I should work on them.
+ Also, thanks to the "Linux Mandrake" distribution.  They have linux_logo
  installed by default... and apparently debian does too.
+ Fixed a bug with reporting K6-3's on 2.0.x kernels.  Thanks to
  Steve Kostecke <steve _at_ kostecke.net>.
+ Fixed a bug while displaying K5 info.  Thanks to sbstone _at_ ntcnet.com
+ Added support for SMP alpha ev6.  Thanks goes to 
  testdrive.compaq.com
+ There's grumbling on linux-kernel about "cleaning up cpuinfo namespace"
  in 2.3.x kernels.  Won't that be fun.
  
1 October 1999
+ Ugh!!! This semester at school has been a lot of work.  I got side-tracked
  and didn't release linux_logo-3.02 yet.. I'll do that now. 
+ I released a patch to clean up /proc/cpuinfo in the linux kernel.. it met
  much hatred and flamage ;)  so I guess it won't be in the kernel.  Also,
  Linus ignored the e-mail.
+ Linux_logo was mentioned in passing in Linux Journal... and in a flame on
  linux-kernel... so I must be doing something right ;)
+ Verified it worked on glibc-2.1.2  [Long story.. but in getting
  Iris Performer for Linux to work I ended up updating my slackware box
  with many new libraries]
+ I am sure once I release this on freshmeat my mailbox will fill with more
  bugs, so stay tuned....

7 January 2000
+ Well, finally have some time for linux_logo again.  The semester of school
  was crazy, but after finals and a trip to Mont Tremblant, Canada, things
  have calmed down a bit.
+ Fix things for Athalon support.  Nope, I don't have one yet [I wish].
  Thanks to Dieter Nützel <dieter.nuetzel _at_ myokay.net>
+ Look at merging some of the debian stuff.
+ It's good to know that linux_logo is Y2K compliant, even if the .lsm
  file format doesn't seem to be.
+ Added a named-pipe example to ./contrib/scripts from Jörg Ziefle 

11 January 2000
+ Made two new directories, "classic_logos" and "banner_logos" and put all of
  the various contributed logos into them.  This should make it a bit easier
  for people to browse and pick which ones they want compiled in.
+ Upload and release

12 January 2000
+ Of course I manage to spell Athlon wrong.  Thanks to alp _at_ unistat.com

13 January 2000
+ Ooops.  More people finding my Athlon problem.  Better release 3.04
+ One month left till my birthday.... plenty of time left to send me 
  a present ;)

RELEASE 3.04

31 January 2000
+ Fix y2k bug with the LSM and hope metalab accepts it...

29 February 2000
+ Added a slackware logo
+ Upped version # to 3.05, just to be consistent, even though I haven't made
  enough changes to constitute a full release...

RELEASE 3.05

11 June 2000
+ I've been very busy.  With schoolwork and everything.  Back in February
  I started a massive re-design, but had to stop.  Now I have some time
  again.
+ I am stuck in Lowell, Massachusetts, with only my 486 laptop, so I thought
  I'd do some linux_logo developing while not playing civ2 on my friend's
  machine.
+ Tore out a lot of old "compatibility" code that I hope not many people used.
  This includes the turn-off periods, and replace background/foreground
  character code.  This makes the code base cleaner, smaller, and makes it
  much easier to implement arbitrary/random logo generation, which is my
  eventual goal.

29 July 2000
+ Believe it or not, I've been working on this off an on the past 2 months.
+ malloc and pointers are your friends!  AHHHH SEGFAULT SEGFAULT SEGFAULT
  Yes, that's what the past few days of linux_logo development have been
  like ;)
+ I got logo file loading/parsing done a few weeks ago.  Today I got 
  ascii/banner/classic logos to all use the same draw_logo function! 
  There's a lot of abstraction, struct passing, pointers, malloc, and 
  even a linked list!  I can't believe it works.  And to think this just
  started out with a bunch of printf's of hard-coded arrays of chars.

4 August 2000
+ Finally got all of the new logo stuff done and working
+ I have a nice K6-2+ to test things on now....

6 August 2000
+ Verified all the cpuinfo files I have work, added ARM support and added
  crusoe and improved Athlon support.
+ Re-write most of the documentation
+ Release 3.9b1 to Freshmeat hopefully.

RELEASE 3.9b1

11 February 2001
+ Started the big sysinfo-rewrite I have been meaning to work on.
+ Worked out the libsysinfo interface.  Should I spin it off as a separate
  project?
+ Final Fantasy 8 intervened

13 February 2001
+ Gave up on the idea of a special birthday release

19 February 2001
+ Started messing with some self-generating Makefiles
+ Got sysinfo_ix86 sort of auto-detecting and working

20 February 2001
+ Fix all occurances of e-mail and web-page to my hopefully permanent
  "vince _at_ deater.net" address.

23 February 2001
+ Wrote "ll" linux_logo in assembly language.  Added in the ll_asm
  directory.

24 February 2001

  after a normal bugfixing period.

RELEASE 3.9b2

16 March 2001
+ Fix GHz output to show 2 decimal points at least.  This is because
  I found on the net some clandestine SMP-Athlon /proc/cpuinfo files.
+ Added preliminary i18n [that is, internationalization] support.
  The first translation was a poorly-done German one [the only
  language besides English I am somewhat understandable in].

3 April 2001

  "linux_logo -L random" option ;)
+ Included debian and redhat banner logos from
  Phillip Jackson <pjacklsu _at_ bellsouth.net>

30 April 2001
+ Touch up the redhat and debian banner logos, from
  Phillip Jackson <pjacklsu _at_ bellsouth.net>
+ Still amazed no i18n fixes have been sent in yet.  

7 June 2001

RELEASE 3.9b4
  
16 October 2001
+ Fix GHz printing for fast chips
+ Add support for ~/.linux_logo and /etc/linux_logo.conf files.

+ Released 3.9b5.  Was going to release 4.0, but the getopt hack
  seems a bit too chancy

RELEASE 3.9b5

22 October 2001
+ Try to free() the stuff I malloc().  I have been lazy because
  typically linux_logo doesn't stay resident so it doesn't make
  much difference.

  though... I shouldn't be making changes like this in b5, I know, but
  95% of people shouldn't be affected by this.

  Shooting for a 13 February special "birthday" release.

RELEASE 4.0

+ Added norwegian bokmaal translation from 
  Per Oeyvind Karlsen [iso-8859-1] <peroyvind _at_ linux-mandrake.com>

RELEASE 4.09

30 March 2005
+ Sorry for lack of updates
+ Fixed to compile with gcc 4.0.  Mainly removing a lot of stupid
  needless (char *) casts.  Thanks to Colin Charles <colin _at_ fedoraproject.org>
  for pointing this out.
+ Updated Italian translation from Marco Colombo <m.colombo _at_ ed.ac.uk>  
+ New Mandrakelinux logo from <peroyvind _at_ linux-mandrake.com>
+ BSD updates from Metgod <metty _at_ hfactorx.org>
+ released linux_logo-4.10

RELEASE 4.10

29 April 2005
+ Embarrassing bug where it always prints out "Trying to open
  $HOME/.linux_logo".  Has that bug really been there for over a year
  with no one noticing?
  (Thanks to Matthias Saou <matthias _at_ rpmforge.net> for noticing)
  
RELEASE 4.11
  
30 April 2005
+ OK, above bug wasn't as old as feared.  It was a problem with some
  debugging output inserted and then forgotten about in the year 
  between 4.09 and 4.10.  I've reverted the behavior and it should
  work a bit better.
+ Made it so even if you don't have i18n installed on your machine,
  linux_logo will still successfully Make the whole way through
  (though with lots of warnings in the po directory).

RELEASE 4.12

15 December 2005
+ Some changes to libsysinfo
+ Looked at http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=linuxlogo
  Fixed what bugs I could

  Bug  #321971

+ Rename "dk.po" to "da.po".  Thanks to Piotr Engelking 
  <inkerman42 _at_ gmail.com>
+ Fix spelling problems in CHANGES file (from debian via maintainer
  Khalid El Fathi <invent _at_ edena-fr.org> ).
+ Inspires by a patch from debian, make it so the configuration file can
  handle empty lines, comments, and empty files.
+ Apply patch to make the -L command line argument override the other types
  of configuration.  (from debian via maintainer Khalid El Fathi
  <invent _at_ edena-fr.org> ).
+ Fix off by one error in allocation of the size of string ~/linux_logo.c

RELEASE 4.14

4 January 2007
+ Support sparc64 on Linux (we obtained some Niagara systems ;) )
+ Add CPU and Memory support for Solaris.
+ Added a swedish translation forwarded along by the debian maintainer.

RELEASE 4.15

27 January 2007
+ Realized I had forgotten to add the swedish translation to the makefile.
  Fixed.
+ Updated slackware logo from Gabor Bak <baboka _at_ slackware.hu>

RELEASE 4.16

28 January 2007
+ Update to install locale info in /usr/share/locale, not /usr/lib/locale
  for FHS compliance.(  from Per Øyvind Karlsen <pkarlsen _at_ mandriva.com> )
+ Add mandriva logo (from Per Øyvind Karlsen <pkarlsen _at_ mandriva.com> )
+ Took a look at the linux_logo code and realized it is in sorry shape,
  started re-writing a lot, we're going to have a 5.0 release... -vmw
+ Audit the source code, removing a bunch of potential buffer overflows -vmw
+ Remove extraneous and dead code -vmw
+ Got rid of the horrific vmw_string.c file, an artifact from a much
  earlier and naive stage of my programming career... -vmw
  
26 June 2007
+ I was busy, neglected linux_logo for a while.  Some e-mails came in
  so back to work.
+ Re-wrote some of the helper functions to be thread safe.
  General cleanups.  I've learned a lot in 10 years ;)
+ Include ubuntu logo by Damian OiDnus Slimak <oidnus _at_ gmail.com>
+ Fix so the Playstation 3 reports right number of CPUs from 
  KolbjÃ¸rn Barmen" <epost _at_ kolla.no>
+ Need to fix Core Duo handling (urgh Intel, could you make the
  cpuinfo even uglier?).  Thanks to Matthias Saou <matthias _at_ rpmforge.net>
  for sending me a few cpuinfo files to work with.
  
28 June 2007
+ Re-wrote command-line and option handling to not use getopt().
  getopt() is handy, but it was a hack to use it for file-based
  option handling as well.

3 July 2007
+ Added avr32 support
+ Made some fake "configure" files that make an attempt at auto-configuring
+ Ensured cross-compiler support works.

4 July 2007
+ Work on i18n support.  It seems to work tolerably well again.
+ More testing of the build scripts.  It works on Irix, Solaris, FreeBSD and
  Linux.

5 July 2007
+ Turn back on logo-selection support.  Make sure all the logos
  I distribute display properly.
+ Ran ispell on the documentation.
+ Added support for choosing logo by names.  Updated all the logos
  to have names.

RELEASE 5.0

9 July 2007
+ Clean up all the trailing whitespace in linux_logo.c
+ Another security pass.  Removed all of the potential buffer
  overruns I could find.  *NOTE* on a properly configured system
  these overruns should not be a security threat, though they
  could lead to segfaults in linux_logo if you pass strings > 8192
  bytes in size to the program.
  Thanks to Secunia Research for bugging me on this issue.

RELEASE 5.01

30 July 2007
+ Minor bugfix in libsysinfo with how errors in parse_string() were
  reported.  An invalid /proc/cpuinfo file could potentially cause
  a segfault.  Found the problem with the zzuf fuzz tool.

31 July 2007
+ Run some more extensive fuzzing.
+ Update the man page.  It referred to problems with the "new" Pentium II
  processors on 2.0.x kernels.
+ Fix another minor bug found by fuzzing where we try to print a NULL
  string if we have a really invalid logo.

RELEASE 5.02

3 January 2008
+ Minor fix so AMD Phenom displays properly.

RELEASE 5.03

12 December 2008
+ Go through the test_proc files I have, re-test and fix
  all of x86 and x86_64.
  
RELEASE 5.04

5 June 2009
+ Some libsysinfo changes.  Quick summary:
  Add frv, microblaze and m32r support.
  Fix some old Cyric chips.
  Fix Sheeva Plug/ARM.
  
RELEASE 5.05

12 June 2009
+ Fixed Ukranian translation to be uk.mo instead of ua.mo
  (from pld-linux patches)
+ Update translations a bit, this is mainly fixes to the Polish.
  (from pld-linux patches)
+ Add pld-linux logo (from pld-linux patches)
+ Added sme linux logo (from sme linux patches)

1 July 2009
+ Fix ./configure to not have issues if /bin/sh is dash.
  This was debian bug #483851.  I wish they would report
  things like this upstream.
+ Fix bugs where you couldn't override the /etc/linux_logo.conf
  file with -D or -L # or -L random_xy options.  Also fixed
  really minor read-past-end-of-buffer issue with random_xy
  handling.
  This should fix debian bugs #510813 and #504717 so hopefully
  they can re-add "-L debian" to their /etc/linux_logo.conf
  and thus debian systems will stop showing the BSD daemon
  by default.

RELEASE 5.06

5 January 2010
+ Some changes to CPU detection

RELEASE 5.07

15 February 2010
+ Update to handle ARM beagleboard cpuinfo

  with more than 100GB of RAM (yes, I have access to such a machine)

RELEASE 5.09

19 February 2010
+ Enable Power6 support
+ Clean up memory detection, bump libsysinfo number.  I hope
  this doesn't break anything.
+ Re-fix the memory printing code.

RELEASE 5.10

14 November 2010
+ Fix for the po Makefile to work with gmake 2.82.
  Patch provided by Edward Sheldrake <ejsheldrake _at_ gmail.com>
+ Fix some warnings from newer gcc.  Obvious fixes, hopefully
  didn't break anything.
+ Test against some new cpuinfo files.
+ Some very minor libsysinfo changes for Xeon cpus.

RELEASE 5.11
